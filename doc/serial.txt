for using serial interface on windows i have
many difficulty so i decided to use linux,
on linux usb-to-serial work great. when
i connect cable, it start working. after i connected
it create devfile /dev/ttyUSB0 and i use this interface
with command cu (call up another system) with following
syntax to connect to my AlteraDE2 RS232 :
cu /dev/ttyUSB0 -s 9600
