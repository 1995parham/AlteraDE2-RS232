for using serial interface on windows i have
many difficulty so i decided to use linux,
on linux usb-to-serial work great. when
i connect cable, it start working. after i connected
it create devfile /dev/ttyUSB0 and i use this interface
with command miniterm with following syntax to connect
to my AlteraDE2 RS232 :
miniterm.py /dev/ttyUSB0 9600
